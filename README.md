# AI PM Coding Challenge - Local LLM Setup & Integration

Today we're going to demystify the "Black Box" of AI by setting up our own local Large Language Model (LLM) using Ollama. 

As an AI Project Manager, understanding how to run, query, and integrate models locally is crucial for understanding latency, privacy implications, and API structures without relying on cloud providers.

```
## Before you start

### Install Ollama from your terminal or their website

https://ollama.com/download

`macOS:`
```BASH
brew install ollama
brew services start ollama
```
`Windows:`
```BASH
choco install ollama
```
`Linux:`
```BASH
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
systemctl start ollama
```

### Launch the Ollama client
```
brew services start ollama
```

```
ollama run llama3.2:3B
```

This step may take a couple minutes.  

To exit the Ollama client type `/bye`.
